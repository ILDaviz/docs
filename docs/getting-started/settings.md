## Introduction

TweakPHP allows you to adjust some settings and customize the app.

In order to do so, click on the gear button in the bottom left corner to navigate to the settings.

## Update

TweakPHP will show you a small dot badge on the settings button indicating that there is a new release available. To update to the latest version, Just navigate to the settings and click on update button to install.

::: warning
Since we have not signed the Mac build, this will download the `dmg` file and opens it so you can simply drag and drop it into the Applications folder.

## PHP Path

To use the full functionality of the app you need to have a PHP installed on your machine.

TweakPHP will use this PHP to run the LSP and make the coding auto-completion work.

::: info
Although it is not mandatory but the app will show you an error if there is no PHP Path set. To bypass this, you can just set a dummy path as the `PHP Path`

## Theme

TweakPHP allows you to select the prefered theme for the app. We have dark and light themes already available and more will come.

## Editor

You can adjust the Editor font size and word wrapping configs.
